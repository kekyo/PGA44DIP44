# PGA44 to DIP44 socket PCB project using EAGLE CAD

## What is this?

* This is very simple electric circuit diagram on EAGLE CAD.
* This is my first trial for learn how to use EAGLE CAD.
* PGA44 <--> DIP44 pin assignments are side by side.
* I made for prototyping CPLD device (Xilinx XC seriese) on the breadboards.

* This is sample auto routing result:
